# yetl

## Purpose

### This projects serves as both a platform to widen my knowelege of python yaml. A second technology is python petl for adhoc etl. I intend to explore other etl python frameworks to petl but this appears to be a solid platform to build on.

## Goals

### Aside from feeding my curiosity I would like to build a etl system that can be described in yaml taking a lot of the leg work out of the process.

## Status

### Very early expermental code not for consumption
